Achievers have a constant need for attainment. They have an internal ﬁre burning inside them. It pushes them to do more, to achieve
more. People with strong Achiever talents feel as if every day starts at zero. By the end of the day they must accomplish something
meaningful to feel good about themselves. And “every day” means every single day — workdays, weekends, holidays, and even
vacations. If the day passes without some form of achievement, no matter how small, Achievers feel dissatisﬁed. Upon ﬁnishing a
challenging project, they rarely seek to be rewarded with a rest or an easy assignment. While they appreciate recognition for past
achievements, their motivation lies in striving toward the next goal on the horizon.

have a strong inner drive — an innate source of intensity, energy, and power that enables them to push hard to get things done. As a
result, they often set the pace and deﬁne productivity levels for the people around them.
